Event Sourcing in Python
========================

A library for event sourcing in Python.

Overview
========

What is event sourcing? One definition suggests the state of an event-sourced application
is determined by a sequence of events. Another definition has event sourcing as a
persistence mechanism for domain driven design. Therefore, this library makes it easy to
define, publish, persist, retrieve, project, and propagate the domain events of a software
application.

It is common for the state of a software application to be distributed across a set of
entities or aggregates. Therefore, this library provides infrastructure to support
event sourcing the state of entities or aggregates in an application, and suggests a
style for coding an application with event-sourced domain model entities or aggregates
that have behaviour which triggers events.

This documentation provides: instructions for :doc:`installing </topics/installing>` the package,
highlights the main :doc:`features </topics/features>` of the library,
describes the :doc:`design </topics/design>` of the software,
the :doc:`infrastructure layer </topics/infrastructure>`,
